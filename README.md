# SSHAWS

`sshaws` is a helper to simplify the *AWS instances ssh access*.

> It will show a list of instances depending on some specified tags and help you to ssh on it.


## Getting Started
> Limitations: sshaws will only display instances with Environment and Application tags defined.

```bash
usage: sshaws [-e Environment_tag] [-n instance_name] [-a Application_tag] [--silent true] [--region xx_yy_j] [-l user ][instance_name]
```
### Examples

```bash
# List all the instances from eu-west-1
> sshaws

Application: *   Environment: *   Name: *   Region: eu-west-1
---------------------------------------------------------

[0] front-prod-1 - 172.16.31.12 (i-0978df6a92b39d434, t2.nano)
[1] front-prod-2 - 172.16.24.226 (i-0b3914e83516392378, t2.nano)
[2] front-staging - 172.16.39.121 (i-0b3914e89237829ad1, t2.micro)
[3] back-prod - 172.16.33.21 (i-0b3914421237829ad1, t3.large)
[4] back-staging - 172.16.19.93 (i-0b391351e237829ad1, t3.micro)

Which one do you want to ssh in?
# WAITING INPUT FROM USER
3
>> Starting a new ssh session to 172.16.33.21
[...] Stablishing SSH connection with the desired server
 ```

```bash
# List all the instances with front on name, from eu-west-1
> sshaws front

Application: *   Environment: *   Name: front   Region: eu-west-1
---------------------------------------------------------

[0] front-prod-1 - 172.16.31.12 (i-0978df6a92b39d434, t2.nano)

 ```

```bash

# List all the instances from eu-west-1 with TAG Environment=staging
> sshaws -e staging

Application: *   Environment: staging   Name: *   Region: eu-west-1
---------------------------------------------------------

[0] front-staging - 172.16.39.121 (i-0b3914e89237829ad1, t2.micro)

 ```

```bash
# List all the instances from eu-west-1 with TAG Environment=staging and back in the name
> sshaws -e staging back

Application: *   Environment: staging   Name: back   Region: eu-west-1
---------------------------------------------------------

[0] back-staging - 172.16.19.93 (i-0b391351e237829ad1, t3.micro)

>> Starting a new ssh session to 172.31.2.93
# If  there is only one instance, it will launch ssh automatically without waiting user input
[...] Stablishing SSH connection with the desired server
```

```bash
# List all the instances from eu-west-1 with TAG Environment=staging and launching ssh with user "test"
> sshaws -e staging -l test

Application: *   Environment: staging   Name: *   Region: eu-west-1
---------------------------------------------------------

[0] front-staging - 172.16.39.121 (i-0b3914e89237829ad1, t2.micro)
[1] back-staging - 172.16.19.93 (i-0b391351e237829ad1, t3.micro)

Which one do you want to ssh in?
# WAITING INPUT FROM USER

### Usage in depth

Download the binary in this repository and execute it, or compile by yourself following the next steps.

```
sshaws
  --app | -a
        Tag Application of the instance (default "*")
  --env | -e
        Tag Environment of the instance (default "*")
  --name | -n
        Instance Name (default "*")
  -l string
        SSH login name (default "")
  --region
        AWS Region (default "eu-west-1")
  --silent | -s
        Show only matching instances IPs
  --version | -v
        Show sshaws version
  --help | -h
        Show this text
```

### Prerequisites

 * **AWS CLI**: You need to have your ~/.aws/credentials in place and with the correct keys.
* **SSH**: You will need ssh, and, if necessary, configure the ssh connection (The configuration in `~/.ssh/configuration` will be applied to awssh).
* **[OPTIONAL] Golang**: If you want to compile `sshaws` you will need the `golang` executable.
